# buckwalter-converter-node
A javascript component for converting between Arabic text and Buckwalter transliteration

NOTE:
 - This library is forked from [stts-se/buckwalter-converter](https://github.com/stts-se/buckwalter-converter) to be compatible with nodejs and commonjs environment.
 - KnockoutJs and lodash is stripped out from the original library to keep the library minimal.
 - Big thanks to stts-se for the great work!

TODO:
1. Write unit tests
